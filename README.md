### This is my first Repository!
I hope to further my knowledge of R and [GitHub](www.github.com) throughout this class.  
I am _really_ hoping I can apply all of these lessons and tips in my own work in the future!  

I will leave you with this photo of my **Favorite Fish**!  ![Fish](https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/caribbean/resources/img/images/species/2411_787.jpg)
