## Introduction:
This is my first **_Quarto_** doc, I will be figuring out how to use it! 

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

## Look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Making Plots
This plot will look at the relationship between **bill length** and **bill depth**.
```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins %>%  # peguin dataset
  ggplot(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color=species))+   #bill length vs depth
  geom_point() 
```
